# BlackJack
This is a project that myself and a partner wrote for our first project in CSCI 4210 'Simulation and Modeling' at the University of Georgia.
It needs to be compiled and run in the sbt shell. The project is a working 'Blackjack' game with functioning GUI.
There are multiple computer-generated files also in the directory on my computer that the program may need to run but this is just an example of my scala programming expertise.
